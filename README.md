# IRIS-flower-species-prediction
##BUSINESS PROBLEM :
''' Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.'''


##BUSINESS OBJECTIVE :
''' Determine species by considering measurement of flowers.'''
##BUSINESS CONSTRAINTS:
'''Minimize Cost of Detection'''
    
##SUCCESS CRITERIA: 
'''Business success criteria - Increase effectiveness of species detection by at least 50%
ML success criteria - Achieve an accuracy of more than 80%
Economic success criteria - Increasing revenue by 20%'''

##Data Understanding:
'''
1.Id : serial number
2.SepalLengthCm : sepal length in cm
3.SepalWidthCm: sepal width in cm
4.PetalLengthCm: petal length in cm
5.PetalWidthCm: petal width in cm
6.Species: species name (setosa,versicolor,virginica) '''
